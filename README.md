# Evan's Reinforcement Learning Blog
The intention of this blog is to share the information I have learned at graduate school as well as to continue learning after.  I will walk through project I have completed at school as well as other interesting projects I have seen.  
  
If there are any papers that are released that I find interesting I will share my thoughts and try to reproduce their results. Some are easier than others as quite a few new papers have related GitHub repositories.  

**Schedule**: I am trying to create new content every Wednesday at 8am central time
