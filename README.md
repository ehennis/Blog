# Evan's Reinforcement Learning Blog
The intention of this blog is to share the information I have learned at graduate school as well as to continue learning after.  I will walk through project I have completed at school as well as other interesting projects I have seen.  
  
If there are any papers that are released that I find interesting I will share my thoughts and try to reproduce their results. Some are easier than others as quite a few new papers have related GitHub repositories.  

**Schedule**: I am trying to create new content every Wednesday at 8am central time

**Blog Link**: [https://eckronsoftware.wordpress.com/](https://eckronsoftware.wordpress.com/)  
  
  
## Folder Structure  
**Black Scholes**: This folder is where I have the notebook for using a Monte Carlo Simulation with the Black Scholes equation to figure out the optimal option premium.  

**CodeCamp/PythonApplication1**: This is my python application that I used for the 2017 Iowa Code Camp.  

**Discretization**: This is a project I created to work through some discretization samples.  

**ImageRecon**: This is for a future blog post about image recognition. I am trying to use a pre-trained NN and add in some fish pictures.  

**ImageReconAndroid**: Same as above but this is the code to run on Android.  

**KArmedBandit**: This was a project to demonstrate a k-armed bandit.  

**TensorFlow**: This folder contains all of my TensorFlow related work.
