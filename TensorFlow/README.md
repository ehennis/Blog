# TensorFlow Projects  
This is the repository where I am doing all of my work in TensorFlow. There are training tutorials, setting up my environment, and a TFv2 conversion project.  
  
**Environment**  
[TF Part 1.ipynb](TF%20Part%201.ipynb): Notebook that sets up my environment.  

**TensorFlow Tutorials**  
[BasicClassification.ipynb](BasicClassification.ipynb) Basic Classification tutorial from TensorFlow.  
[TextClassification.ipynb](TextClassification.ipynb): Text Classification tutorial from TensorFlow.  
[Regression.ipynb](Regression.ipynb): Regression tutorial from TensorFlow.  
[Overfitting.ipynb](Overfitting.ipynb): Overfitting tutorial from TensorFlow.  
  
**TensorFlow version 2**  
[MonteCarloBlackScholes-TF2.ipynb](MonteCarloBlackScholes-TF2.ipynb): Converting my Monte Carlo project to TensorFlow v2.  
[DDQN-TFv2.ipynb](DDQN-TFv2.ipynb): Converted my DDQN notebook to TensorFlow v2.
